  "about_text1": "The Marine Geosciences Laboratory (LaboGeo) operates within the epartment of Oceanography at the Federal University of Espírito Santo. Established in 2008, LaboGeo conducts scientific research in the field of Marine Geology and Geophysics, focusing on aspects related to coastal and marine sediment dynamics, sedimentary records of sea level fluctuations, climate, and geological and biological habitat mapping and their vulnerabilities. LaboGeo is involved in various national research networks and collaborates with international partners.The laboratory’s participation in national and global projects is exemplified by our involvement and coordination in initiatives such as INCT, Marine Sciences, IODP, PELD, SeaBed 2030, and our position in committees like PGGM, GEOHAB, the IODP Scientific Committee, CAPES, among others.",
  "about_text2": "Our commitment is to take science as the foundation of knowledge to better understand the natural processes that occur on our planet over recent geological time, and to establish a strong focus on human resource development. The laboratory’s premise is the continuous interaction with the public sector and the provision of open information to society. We believe that scientific and technological development, through education in a healthy group environment, is essential not only for scientific progress but also for personal growth and all the national social and economic sectors. Science allows us to seek answers, even though with each answer, more questions might arise. We believe that education, through science, is a transformative agent in society.",
